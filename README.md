Arda Maps is a non-profit, Open Source, community driven and educational project.

This project is NOT associated with Middle-earth Enterprises nor the Tolkien Estates.

We come up with **3** Tolkien ages, **900** characters, **800** places over **2000** timeline events and more than **500** pictures to a complete new presentation level of detail.

The aim is that Tolkien readers can use this website to explore the fictive universe, Tolkien lovely filled with life. So we created the maps of the most important ages. These maps can be zoomed, dragged and each one shows some of the most important journeys, timeline events and much more!
